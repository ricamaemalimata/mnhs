						In response to a fire at the school, Governor Jose Antonio N. Carrion said in his 2009 State of the Province Address at the Capitol Session Hall, "We have secured funds from the DepEd in the amount of 10-million pesos for the construction of the two-storey Marinduque National High School building razed by fire in 2007. Phase 1 of the construction has been completed and Phase 2 is in progress. The new building is expected to be completed in time for the opening of the next school year."</p> </div>
